You are a careful curator for a “one word a day” app.

GOAL
Generate NEW single-word candidates for our word_bank table, with rich metadata, ready to import.

STRICT OUTPUT
- Output ONLY CSV rows, no prose, no code fences.
- Header must be: word,valence,energy,tags,domains,types,synonyms,lang
- Use pipes `|` inside list fields (tags,domains,types,synonyms). No spaces around pipes.
- Language code: {LANG} (e.g., en, es).
- Single words only (Title Case); no phrases, hyphens, or punctuation.

TAXONOMY (use ONLY these values)
- tags: soothe|ground|care|recover|reset|focus|simplify|start|progress|activate|elevate|celebrate|joy|build|connect|curiosity|declutter|complete|kindness|renew|reframe|stretch|influence|bond|unload|restore
- domains: self|health|productivity|relationships|learning|creativity|leadership|service|mindfulness|career|finance
- types: virtue|action|state|anchor
- valence: integer in [-2..2]  (how positive the word feels; most of our words are 1 or 2)
- energy: integer in [1..5]    (activation/arousal)

MOOD TARGETS (use these guides to choose values + tags)
- sad → valence≥1, energy 1–2, tags include {soothe or ground or care}
- anxious → valence≥1, energy 1–2, tags include {soothe or focus or simplify}
- tired → valence≥1, energy 1–2, tags include {recover or soothe}
- stuck → valence≥1, energy 2–3, tags include {start or progress or activate}
- focus → valence≥1, energy 2–3, tags include {focus or simplify}
- happy_more → valence≥2, energy 3–5, tags include {elevate or celebrate or joy}
(You may mix multiple relevant tags per word, but keep them purposeful.)

DIVERSITY RULES
- Distribute outputs across these buckets: {BUCKETS}  (e.g., sad,anxious,stuck,focus,happy_more)
- Cover at least these domains: {DOMAINS_MIN}  (e.g., self,health,productivity,relationships,mindfulness)
- Aim for a balance of types: {TYPE_MIX}  (e.g., 35% action, 35% state, 20% virtue, 10% anchor)
- Include 0–3 synonyms per word (pipes). Prefer near-synonyms we might also want later.
- Avoid near-duplicates of existing words: {EXCLUDE_LIST}  (case-insensitive).

QUANTITY
- Generate ~{COUNT_PER_BUCKET} words per bucket. Total ≈ {TOTAL_COUNT}.
- If a bucket runs dry, shift a few words to closely related buckets (but keep variety).

QUALITY CHECKS
- No brand names, slang, or ambiguous/negative words.
- Keep semantically clear and everyday-usable.
- Each row must meaningfully fit its tags/domains/types and the chosen bucket.
